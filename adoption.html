            <h2>Policy:</h2>
      			<p>To ensure the rabbits in our care go on to live happy lives we have a few measures put in place before you can adopt from us.</p>
      			<p>To adopt through Wellington Rabbit Rescue you will need to have an inspection of your yard/enclosure/room to ensure it is big enough and secure enough from predators. (This may be done via photos in most cases!)</p>
      			<p>If you are using an enclosed area rather than having your rabbits free-range then it must be a minimum size of 2 metres (length) by 1 metre (width) by 1 metre (height) with a warm, dry covered area that is at least 61x61cm. Please note - this is a MINIMUM. We prefer much, much more space than this.</p>
      			<p>The best option is to have your rabbits free-range in a securely fenced back yard, or free range in your home. Another great option is to attach a permanent run to an existing hutch so your rabbits always have the freedom to exercise whenever they wish!</p>
      			<p>We endeavour to only rehome rabbits in pairs, unless of course they are going to be a companion to your existing rabbit. We feel it’s not fair to keep a rabbit all on their own as they are very social creatures and need the company of their own kind.</p>
      		  <P>If you are adopting a rabbit as a companion for an existing pet then you will need to bring them out to have a meet &amp; greet with any WRR rabbit you would like to adopt! This is to ensure they will get along, as rabbits can be very particular about their friends. We are happy to give you advice on how to introduce and bond rabbits.</P>
      			<P>Rabbits can live until they are 10-12 years. You need to be ready to care for your new rabbit for this long. Rabbits require annual health checks and vaccinations as part of their lifelong care.</P>
      			<P>All of our rabbits are desexed and vaccinated before they become available for adoption.</P>
            <P>When adopting a rabbit from us you will be given a care guide and receive continued support from us should you have any queries or questions.</P>
      			<P>If for any reason you can no longer care for your rabbit then they must be returned to our care.
          </div>

      		<div id="pricing">
            <h2>Pricing:</h2>
      			<P>Our adoption fee is $80 for one rabbit or $140 for a pair. This money goes towards the cost of desexing, vaccinations &amp; other veterinary costs while in our care.</P>
              <P>It costs us $140 for a male to be desexed &amp; $210 for a female, plus vaccinations at $25 each. If you would like to help with these costs, check our <a ref=/help>donations page</a> for detais on how to donate.</P>
